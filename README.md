# MNIST-Hand-Written-Digits-Recognition

## Overview
Here we will be creating a Deep Neural Network model that recognizes the hand written digits. MNIST is nothing but a dataset that contains 60000 training images and 10000 testing images of hand written digits and these are actually gray scale images. For more information refer my blog https://mlprojectshub.blogspot.com/2020/07/mnist-hand-written-digits-recognition.html 

 **The below are the sample images of MNIST dataset**

## Accuracy and Loss

I have used Categorical Cross Entropy as a loss function and Adam Optimizer and got the accuracy of 0.99 and loss of 0.01
